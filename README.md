# colornames

A Python library for finding the names of colors.

The `colornames` library will give you the name of any RGB color.
If the exact color doesn't have a name, the closest match will be used instead.

The color names are all from [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F).
